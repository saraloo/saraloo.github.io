## Education

**Doctor of Philosophy (Science), University of Sydney, Australia**
March 2015 – September 2018
Thesis title: ‘Mathematical modelling of the evolution of human behaviours and strategic choice’
Supervisor: Professor Peter Kim, in collaboration with Distinguished Professor Kristen Hawkes, University of Utah.
My research focussed on developing mathematical models for the evolution of human behaviours with insights from hunter-gatherer communities.  One examiner commented: “The written thesis is one of the best examples of communication of mathematical modelling in a PhD thesis that I have read in my 15 years of examining theses.” 

Bachelor of Medical Mathematics (Advanced Honours & Dean’s Scholar), University of Wollongong, Australia
2011 – 2014 
First Class Honours with an International Studies Minor. Recipient of Undergraduate EIS Faculty Scholarship. 
Honours thesis title: ‘Mathematical Modelling in Tumour Growth and its Treatment’. 
Supervisor: Associate Professor Annette Worthy

Study Abroad Program, University of Illinois, USA 
January 2013 – July 2013 

Illawarra Christian School, Cordeaux Campus, Australia
1999 – 2010
