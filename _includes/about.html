                <p> Mathematical evolutionary biologist </p>
		<p> My studies began began at the University of Wollongong, where I undertook an undergraduate degree in Medical Mathematics. This intersection of maths and science lead me to my honours year, where I studied various mathematical models of cancer therapy, under the supervision of Dr. Annette Worthy. </p>
		<p> I then moved to the University of Sydney for my PhD, supervised by A/Prof Peter Kim. I was enticed by the quest to understand human life history. In my thesis I considered the evolution of male reproductive strateiges, working closely with Distinguished Professor Kristen Hawkes at the University of Utah. Part of my thesis was completed during my time at the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis, after being chosen for the Young Scientist's Summer Program, working with Dr. Ulf Diekmann and Professor Karl Sigmund in the Evolution and Ecology Program. My focus continues to be in the application of dynamic mathematical models to evolutionary dynamics. </p>
		<p> This has lead me to my current postdoctoral position at the University of New South Wales, with Professor Mark Tanaka. We are currently working on several projects to understand pathogen evolution. What can patterns of variation tell us about the evolution of pathogens? How may pathogen traits evolve during the course of an epidemic? </p>
