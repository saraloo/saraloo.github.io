### Infectious Disease Projections

I am interested in using real world data to understand dynamics of infectious disease. In particular, I am involved with the coordination of the [COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub](http://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org) and [Flu Scenario Modeling Hub](http://fluscenariomodelinghub.org). 


### Cultural evolution and infectious diseases

How do infectious diseases emerge in human populations? Different factors affect how these emergence events can arise. In particular, changes to environments, human behaviour or cultural changes can increase or decrease the exposure of human populations to new microbes. Understanding how these changes shape the risk of emergence is an important question in understanding the emergence of infectious disease.


### Evolution of pathogens, across multiple scales

Mutation of pathogen genomes occurs within-host, but transmission occurs between-hosts. Understanding selection at both of these scales can give insight into the evolution of pathogens during epidemics. 


### Human life-history evolution and the evolution of reproductive strategies in hunter-gatherers

Evolutionary anthropology seeks answers to the eternal philosophical question: how have we come to be? Studies within evolutionary anthropology attempt to explain the evolution of uniquely human behaviours by investigating the mechanisms and tradeoffs that drive different evolutionary trajectories. I have developed dynamic mathematical models to investigate payoffs that define divergent evolutionary pathways of male strategic choice. This is done by comparing the evolutionary equilibria of these models at great ape-like and hunter-gatherer-like life histories.
